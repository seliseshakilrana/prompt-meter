# prompt-meter-web

Blocks starter app: React 18 + Vite + TypeScript, with a real hosted Blocks IAM login and a project-scoped profile page as the landing page.

Every Blocks API call in this app goes through [`@seliseblocks/client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@seliseblocks/client) via a single `createBlocksClient()` instance in `src/lib/blocks/client.ts` — there is no hand-written `fetch()` wrapper for Blocks endpoints anywhere in this app. Each SDK module is exercised in context rather than in one dedicated demo panel: `auth` in the hosted login flow, `iam` on the Profile page and user menu, and `localization` in `LocalizationProvider`. Add more pages under `src/features/` as your app needs them.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

`.env` already has working defaults for this project — you only need to fill in `VITE_BLOCKS_OIDC_CLIENT_ID` (see below) before login will work.

## Login setup (required)

This app signs users in directly against this project's tenant (no CLI-style account impersonation) through Blocks IAM's hosted IdP controller. Before login will work, register a **public** OIDC client for this app in Blocks IAM with:

- `redirect_uris`: EVERY origin the app is served from, each with `/login/callback` -- your dev origin, and each deployed URL. `blocks release setup` assigns a random-suffixed domain (find it via `blocks release repos list --json`, the `url` field), and until that origin's callback is registered the first login there fails with `redirect_uri_not_registered`; `blocks release deploy --register-callback` registers it for you.
- `client_type`: `public` (no client secret — this is a browser app and cannot keep one; this scaffold never asks for or ships a client secret).
- `tenant_id` used for login: this project's tenant (`VITE_BLOCKS_X_BLOCKS_KEY`).

Then set `VITE_BLOCKS_OIDC_CLIENT_ID` in `.env` to the new client's id. Until then, the login page shows a setup notice instead of failing silently.

## Testing login locally over HTTPS on the real project domain

Blocks SSO sets a **Secure, domain-scoped** session-related cookie as part of the OIDC exchange; browsers refuse to store or send that on plain `http://localhost`. To test the real login flow locally, run the dev server on the project's actual domain over HTTPS instead of `localhost`:

1. Find the app's registered Blocks domain in the Blocks OS project settings, or ask whoever created the project. It must match the OIDC redirect URI's host.
2. Point it at your machine — add to your hosts file (`/etc/hosts`, or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` as Administrator): `127.0.0.1  <domain>`.
3. Confirm `.env` has `VITE_BLOCKS_DEV_HOST=<domain>` (generated from `--app-domain`) and `VITE_BLOCKS_DEV_PORT=5173`.
4. Generate a local HTTPS cert for that exact domain: `npm run cert`. Trust it in your OS store to remove the browser warning (command printed by the script), then restart the browser.
5. `npm run dev` -> open `https://<domain>:<port>` (not `localhost`).
6. Register that exact origin's `/login/callback` as a redirect URI on the OIDC client — byte-for-byte, including the port.

`.cert/` is gitignored — each developer generates and trusts their own cert.

## Blocks Release deployment

The scaffold includes `Dockerfile` and `nginx.conf` for Blocks Release. The Release service must pass Docker build arg `ci_build=<environment>` plus the public `VITE_BLOCKS_*` build args documented in the Dockerfile. The generated `package.json` also provides `build:dev`, `build:test`, `build:stg`, `build:iat`, `build:uat`, `build:preprod`, `build:prodshadow`, and `build:prod` scripts for local checks.

During each environment build, `scripts/write-release-env.mjs` writes `dist/env.<environment>` from client-safe Docker build args or local `.env` files. Root `.env` remains gitignored and must not be committed.

## What's included

- `/login` — login page (redirects to Blocks IAM).
- `/login/callback` — completes the hosted IAM callback via `blocksClient.auth.idp.callback()`, then returns to the page you started from.
- `/` and `/profile` — protected; redirect to `/login` when signed out.
- Sidebar + topbar shell matching the `@seliseblocks/blocks-kit` look (icon-only rail on narrow screens, avatar dropdown, notifications menu, active-item accent bar).
- `blocks/localization/*.en.json` local i18n seed files for AI or human edits. Sync them through `blocks localization validate` and `blocks localization push`; the runtime app reads Localization service data through `blocksClient.localization`.

IAM's hosted login sets the session as a **Secure, httpOnly** cookie by default -- this app never reads, stores, or refreshes a token itself. "Signed in" is determined by calling `blocksClient.auth.userInfo()` (`GET /iam/v4/auth/me`), which the browser's cookie authenticates automatically; this is different from `blocksClient.iam.me()`, the full IAM profile call used on the Profile page. Logging out calls `blocksClient.auth.logout()` so IAM ends the session server-side. A cached bearer token (and `blocksClient.auth.oidc.refreshToken()` to refresh it) is only used if a tenant's OIDC config explicitly returns tokens in the response body instead of a cookie.
